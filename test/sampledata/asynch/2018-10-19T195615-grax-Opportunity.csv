If only the defense had shown up to play for at least 1 quarter of the game? I won?t get started on a tangent, I promise.   Spoke with Ariel this morning and listed below is an estimate for the work that we spoke about on Friday. I have highlighted in red one outstanding question. Right now, I am basing that calculation off of whichever field is smallest (7 day, 14 day, or 30 day avg.). Please let me know if that is fine with you.   A few other quick things:   1)	All of the current ?Average Calculation? work is in QA, not QA4. There have been updates to some of the code that we updated in QA in QA4 so we will need to bring our code over to QA4 and make sure that we are not impacting the current code in QA4 at all. That is why this is listed below with some additional time. 2)	As I mentioned, I am out Wednesday afternoon until the following Wednesday. Ariel is aware of all of the components to be created/updated and I will touch base with Jim to make sure he is up to speed in case Ariel has any questions/concerns. 3)	Currently, we have 20 hours left in our current SOW. We have three estimates, two of which we reviewed Friday, and one new one below:  a.	Next Order Calculations (30 hours) b.	VF Pages (42 hours) c.	CSV Logic (70 hours)   Please let me know how you would like to proceed and we can work from there. Thanks Chris and estimate below on the ?Next Order Calculations?:   Next Order Calculations: (30 hours total) 1.	Highest consumption (fields Avg. 7, 14, or 30) / Strips on hand (6 hours) i.	Have Trigger go 10 days prior to the estimated run out date ii.	Example 50 Strips on hand / Highest Consumption (Avg # is 1.8, DO NOT Round) a.	Would have a value here of 27.7 (take the shortest option of days, here would be 27) and we would send the alert 10 days prior to estimated run out date 2.	Update the rounding from the current batch i.	Create formula fields to round the current values (Test Range (7 Days), 14, 30 (3 fields) 3.	Alert when the 10 day has come: i.	Option 1 create a Case on the Person Account (Patient) (4 hours) a.	Assign the Case to ""Patient Reorder Case Queue"" 1.	Create this Case Queue b.	Case subject ""Potential Reorder"" 1.	Create this value in the Case subject dropdown c.	Category ""Potential Reorder 1.	Create this value in the Category dropdown ii.	Option 2 create an Opportunity for ""Automatic Refill"" (6 hours) a.	Dependent picklist for (30, 60, 90 day shipment). Each are options (3 total) b.	Will Lancets be included? 1.	Yes 2.	No c.	Opportunity Name: SET d.	Close Date: Today() e.	Stage: Ready to Process f.	Type: Re-order g.	Method of Shipment: USPS 1.	Create new value h.	Create related Opportunity Product(s) 1.	Product Name: Telcare Glucose Test Strips (50 ct) 2.	Quantity: Run Rate (# of Test Strips used each day, actual value) * day selected in Day Refill Period i.	2 Strips per day * 30 day refill period = 60 / 50 (# of Test Strips) = 1.2 (Dependent on which average? 7, 14 or 30 day?) ii.	Round the value up to the next whole number iii.	In this example the Quantity would be set as 2 3.	Sales Price: Defaulted value from the Pricebook i.	Create 2nd related Opportunity Product if ""Lancet Required"" Question is ""true"" 1.	Products Name: TL001 (Grab product name) 2.	Quantity: # of Telcare Glucose Test Strips (50 ct) / 2 i.	Example: Order is for Quantity of 4 Test Strips, we would the Lancet Product with a Quantity of 1 ii.	We do NOT round up, we round down to the nearest whole number. Customer has 3 ordered a quantity of 3 Test Strips (150 total), we still include 1 Lancet Product  iii.	Option 3 flag a new field on the Account and then this will appear in the report (6 hours) a.	Create a new checkbox field on the Account for ""Automatic Refill"" and set this value to true if we are at 10 days or less b.	Create a new ""Date/Time"" report setting NOW() in this value when this field is set to true c.	When a Opportunity with the type of ""Reorder"" is created and related to this Person Account, and the Closed Won date is after the newly created Date field, then we will set the ""Date/Time"" to false and the ""Automatic Refill"" box to false d.	Create a basic Program with the specific Partner Program and the field is ""True"" 1.	Create a distribution list for this report   Bring over and merge all components from QA to QA4: 4 hours New/updated components: 22 hours QA/Deployment: 4 hours   Total: 30 hours","Closed Won","6","28000","100","28000","160","2018-02-28 00:00:00","Existing Business","2/12 - TSS - Order is pending","Employee Referral","1","1","Closed","Closed","000000000000000AAA","1","01s46000003KntnAAC","00546000000ULUHAA4","2018-02-05 17:26:18","00546000000ULUHAA4","2018-03-08 21:35:32","00546000000ULUHAA4","2018-03-21 10:52:17","","2018-03-08 21:35:32","2018","1","","",""

One of the main topics in the morning was to implement Notifications in their current PoC which is functionality that they feel is sorely lacking for their user audience.  Accenture asked me to architect out a solution prior to the meeting and working with Patrick, I put together a straw man of enabling solutions based on some lambda?s that will run every minute against their existing Dynamo DB on Amazon.  The email and text notifications would utilize Amazon Simple Messaging Service. The scope expanded a little during the meeting. I gave an estimate of 40 hours to implement this functionality.  I have a meeting scheduled with Ashley and Patrick for tomorrow morning.   Everyone on the team (Tim O, Beth, Bob L.) were in agreement that they want to move forward on this.  I need to ping Bob Lancelot to find out what PO we will bill against.    Secondly, just wanted approval from Joe and Tim to move forward on this mini project with Pat and myself as the resources, since it has to be completed in 14 days and pushed to users in 21 days, the schedule is accelerated.","Closed Won","6","12000","100","12000","80","2018-05-16 00:00:00","New Business","TSS - 5/14 - Bob Lancelot gave verbal","Employee Referral","1","1","Closed","Closed","000000000000000AAA","1","01s46000003KntnAAC","00546000000ULUHAA4","2018-05-08 16:20:36","00546000000ULUHAA4","2018-05-16 15:03:20","00546000000ULUHAA4","2018-05-17 10:56:23","","2018-05-16 15:03:20","2018","2","","",""

The Project Manager for the effort is Michelle Kudirka, the Scrum Master is Gabe Coleman, and the overall CRM Program Manager is Hilda Sastre, all of whom have been CC?ed here by way of introduction.     Michelle will be reaching out to you shortly to see if we can setup a call.

Thanks.  Regarding Einstein Analytics, it's another sore subject, but they are a big Tableau shop. Traditionally, the company line from the CIO has been no Wave/EA.  However, we're starting to break down that wall and some of the businesses are more open to it as they find EA isn't as nimble with Salesforce and doesn't provide predictive capabilities.  BSC owns a number of SF Dynamic Dashboards, but that's where licenses end today as far as EA.  Any help you can provide driving EA is appreciated.  Also, I just texted with Chad Thompson, who leads BSC's Salesforce Center of Excellence (Rohit's boss).  He is interested in the dashboard level view of the Global, China, and Japan orgs.  I will invite him to the meeting on Thursday.  He may not attend, but good to at least get the visibility and raise Chad's interest with Rohit.  Thanks again.  Patrick     Patrick M.
